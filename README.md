Social Valuation Task in Web Browser

## svt ideas
- subtract points for wrong answer
    - 2 pts for correct, -1 pt for incorrect, to create a greater penalty for getting answers wrong
- might want to add $3 threshold at 100% because people might stop trying once they get the maximum $2
- big plus 1 after correct answer (instead of tiny increase on progress bar) for more reward
- should button colors swap randomly after each round (like in Behrens et al)
- should shape of buttons be different
    - same throughout all rounds
    - different each round
    
## programming ideas
- prevent csrf
