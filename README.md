Social Valuation Task in Web Browser

## svt ideas
- subtract points for wrong answer
    - 2 pts for correct, -1 pt for incorrect, to create a greater penalty for getting answers wrong
- might want to add $3 threshold at 100% because people might stop trying once they get the maximum $2
- continuous $
- chunk of all wrong answers
- advisor feedback
    - face
    - emoji
    - photo
    - words
        - you should've followed
        - sorry
- big plus 1 after correct answer (instead of tiny increase on progress bar) for more reward
- should button colors swap randomly after each round (like in Behrens et al)
- name + avatar in corner
- attention check
    - icon for must choose
    - check in every 20
        - stand up wiggle
- cheering gif
- sounds

## todo
- show correct in middle
    - user icon if advisor
- bigger buttons on big screen
- randomize side of colors
- breaks every x rounds
- sound form
- do https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_Negative_Affect_Schedule automatically
